"""Browser slot identity for diagnostics and ownership tracking.

Each active Camoufox session is bound to exactly one BrowserSlot. Slot
state is in-memory only; persistence is optional and out of scope for C1.

Capacity=1 always uses slot-0. When capacity>1 is introduced (after
benchmark), each slot gets its own profile directory (slot-{id}) so Firefox
profile locks never clash across concurrent owners.
